# House Price Prediction

This project is focused on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the sale price of a house based on its features.

## Project Overview

House prices are influenced by various factors like location, size, condition, and many more. This project takes a dataset with such features and applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection techniques to create a model that can predict house prices effectively.

## Project Structure

- **house_price.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset (if applicable).
- **models/**: Directory where trained models are saved (if applicable).
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt**: A list of Python libraries required to run the project.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following key features:

- **LotArea**: Lot size in square feet.
- **YearBuilt**: Year the house was constructed.
- **TotalBsmtSF**: Total square feet of basement area.
- **GrLivArea**: Above-ground living area in square feet.
- **FullBath**: Number of full bathrooms.
- **BedroomAbvGr**: Number of bedrooms above ground level.
- **GarageCars**: Size of garage in car capacity.
- **SalePrice**: The target variable representing the sale price of the house.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
    cd house-price-prediction
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook house_price.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook includes steps to clean and preprocess the data, such as handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Feature Engineering**: Various techniques are applied to extract meaningful features that improve model performance.
- **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Multiple models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest are trained and evaluated. The notebook also includes performance metrics like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an R-squared value of [Your Score] on the test dataset, indicating how well the model can explain the variance in house prices.

## Future Work

- Incorporate additional features to enhance model accuracy.
- Implement cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
- Explore advanced models such as Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks.
- Deploy the model as a web application using Flask or Django.
